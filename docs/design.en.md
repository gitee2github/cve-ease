## 1.introduction

CVE (general vulnerability disclosure) is the key information related to system security and stability, so it is particularly important to process and manage CVE information. Based on this, the CVE vulnerability management system of CVE-ease is developed to achieve real-time access, management and broadcast of vulnerability information.



## 2. Main function

The main functions of CVE ease are as follows:

* CVE information acquisition and analysis
* CVE information sorting and storage
* Storage and update of CVE information database
* View historical CVE and real-time CVE information
* Real time tracking of CVE status
* Real time broadcast of CVE dynamic information
